        <p>I first discovered this <strong><em>AMAZING</em></strong> brownie recipe after really craving brownies, and I tried the first recipe i found and instantly fell in love. This is that recipe with slight modifications.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>Butter Chicken is a classic Indian dish made with marinated & grilled chicken (Tandoori chicken), simmered in a creamy tomato gravy/curry. The sauce is super silky, buttery, aromatic and mildly spicy. This lip-smacking and delicious dish is hugely popular among the Indian food lovers across the world.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 180&deg;C. Line long rectangular pan with foil or parchment paper. </li>
                <li>Put cocoa powder and chopped chocolate in a heat-proof bowl.</li>
                <li>Make brown butter: Melt butter in a light-coloured saucepan over medium-low heat. Once foaming and spitting, stir and scrape bottom with a spatula every 10-15 seconds. 
                    Grainy white milk solids will begin to appear on the bottom, Continue for 5-10 minutes(go by senses, not time). 
                    When foam clears and spitting noises go silent, watch closely: the milk solids will toast in seconds. 
                    As soon as the solids thurn brown and smell nutty, remove pan from heat so it doesn't burn.</li>
                <li>Immediately pour hot brown butter into prepared bowl to cool.</li>
                <li>With a stand mixer, whip suagrs, vanilla and eggs on medium-high until thick, smooth, fluffy and lightened in colour. For moist, rich brownies, stop 4-5 minutes. For slightly more height and fluff, whip for 8-10 minutes until very thick and pale.</li>
                <li>Reduce speed to low. Slowly pour chocolate-butter mixture into egg foam mixture until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Using a spatula, fold in flour and salt until just incorporated. Fold in additional chocolate if using. Batter will be very thick.</li>
                <li>Scoop and spread batter evenly into prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Bake 25 minutes until surface is glossy and just set(not jiggly in centre). Do not overbake. They will finish cooking as they cool.</li>
                <li>Let cool at least 30 minutes before removing from pan to slice</li>
            </ol>
