        <p>Butter Chicken is a classic Indian dish made with marinated & grilled chicken (Tandoori chicken), simmered in a creamy tomato gravy/curry.
            The sauce is super silky, buttery, aromatic and mildly spicy. This lip-smacking and delicious dish is hugely popular among the Indian food lovers across the world.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Tomatoes- 8oz passata/ canned tamtor puree, 1/3 cup double concentration tomato paste, 1 14oz can of whole peeled tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Greek Yogurt</li>
                <li>Spices- Garam Masala</li>
                <li>Kashmiri Red chilli powder</li>
                <li>Coriander and cumin powder</li>
                <li>Kasuri methi- dried fenugreek leaves</li>
                <li>Cashews</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instuctions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Marinade -For this recipe you require 500 grams (1.1 lbs) boneless chicken. You can use thighs or breasts like the way I use. A lot of people prefer thighs for the flavor and additional fats. If using chicken breasts be prepared to leave it in the marinade for a minimum of 12 hours for best results. </li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Here are the other ingredients required to marinate the chicken:</li>

            
                    <ul>
                        <li>3/4 to 1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                        <li>1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1/3 to 3/4 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder</li>
                        <li>3/4 to 1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon kasuri methi</li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon turmeric (haldi, optional)</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
                        <li>3/4 to 1 tablespoon oil</li>
                        <li>3/4 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
                        <li>1/3 cup Greek yogurt</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Make sure there is no excess moisture on your chicken. Pat dry with kitchen tissues/paper, if required. Add red chili powder, salt and lemon juice. Mix well, cover and rest for 20 mins. This step seasons your chicken well and this is always followed by the Indian restaurant chefs. (But if you don't care, you may marinate everything at one shot using all the marinade ingredients at once.)</li>
                <li>Later add ginger garlic paste, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, kasuri methi, turmeric and hung curd/ Greek yogurt. Mix well and cover. Let the chicken rest in the marinade for a minimum of 12 hours in the refrigerator. The longer you leave the more tender and juicer the chicken is going to be. You can leave this for a maximum of 48 hours.</li>
                <li>When you are ready to make the sauce, prepare the following ingredients. Keep the chicken out of the refrigerator, as we don't want to grill/ pan-fry the cold chicken.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 tablespoon butter</li>
                        <li>3/4 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
                        <li>1 to 2 green chilies (deseed,slit or chop, avoid for kids)</li>
                        <li>1 to 2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or paprika (adjust to suit your taste and color)</li>
                        <li>1 to 1½ teaspoon garam masala (adjust to taste, divided)</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon cumin powder (optional)</li>
                        <li>1 to 1½ teaspoon coriander powder (optional)</li>
                        <li>½ tablespoon kasuri methi crushed</li>
                        <li>1 cinnamon (optional, 2 inch piece, if using Ceylon cinnamon, feel free to use more)</li>
                        <li>4 green cardamoms (optional)</li>
                        <li>4 cloves (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                <l1>I have updated this recipe to use onions. It is optional but helps to cut down the sour taste of the tomatoes, especially if you are using canned tomatoes or passata. Heat 1 to 2 tbsp oil in a pan and add 1½ cups (130 grams) sliced onions (1 medium yellow onion) and saute on a medium heat until slightly golden, for 7 to 8 minutes. You don't need to brown them. Cool down slightly and add to the blender.</l1>
                <li>To the same blender jar add tomatoes - you can either use</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>600 grams (1.3 lbs.) diced fresh tomatoes or 1 cup passata/ canned tomato puree or ⅓ cup double concentrate tomato paste or 1 - 14 oz can whole peeled tomatoes.</li>
                        <li>Also add 28 whole cashews (42 grams, ⅓ cup) - (or omit nuts to substitute with ¼ to ⅓ heavy cream later at the end)</li>
                        <li>Pour half cup water to the blender. Grind to a smooth puree. Alternately, If you do not have a powerful blender, you may soak the cashews in ½ cup hot water for 30 mins and then puree them separately in a small coffee grinder like the way I did.</li>

                    </ul>
                <li>To make the cashew cream, I grind the cashews first to a powder and then add ¼ cup water and grind again. Pour another ¼ cup water and grind again. Puree them very smooth.</li>
                <h2>Make Butter Chicken Sauce</h2>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a pan. Add the optional whole spices - cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms. Once they begin to sizzle, add ginger garlic paste, green chilies (leave out for kids) and fry on a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes till the raw smell goes away.</li>
                <li>Do not burn.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat. Stir in the red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder and coriander powder.</li>
                <li>Pour the puree. If your puree is not smooth strain it to the pan.</li>
                <li>Use a sturdy spoon to strain and discard the residue.</li>
                <li>Mix well and bring this to a boil on a medium high heat. Be careful as this can easily splatter.</li>
                <li>Cover partially and let boil on a medium heat, stirring often, until thick. This takes about 12 to 15 mins, depending on the kind of cookware and stove.</li>
                <li>This is how it should look, at this stage stir in the cashew cream or puree if you made it separately. (If you are substituting cashews with heavy cream, wait till the end to include it. Do not add here)</li>
                <li>Pour 1½ cups hot water and mix well. (If you are not using cashews, cut down to 1 cup)</li>
                <li>Simmer this, partially covered for 10 mins or until the sauce thickens & traces of fats/butter are visible on top of the sauce. Meanwhile proceed with the next step.</li>
                <h2>Grill the chicken on the stove top or Bake in the oven</h2>
                <li>Make sure your chicken is not too cold.</li>
                <p>Option 1: To use oven, preheat the oven to 240 C or 460 F for at least 15 minutes. Skew the chicken on to soaked wooden skewers or place on a greased tray and bake for 20 to 22 minutes, depending on the size of chicken pieces. In between you will have to turn to the other side.</p>
                <p>Option 2: To pan-fry/grill chicken on griddle/tawa. Add one tablespoon oil/butter or ghee and place the chicken pieces spacing them apart. Fry on a medium heat for 2 mins. Ignore the moisture oozing out of the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces to the other side, don't burn and do not overcook.</p>
                <li>Cook till the chicken is just done and all the moisture evaporates. Optional – If you want browned chicken, increase the flame to high and roast until they turn golden or light brown on both the sides. Be careful as this can easily burn the masala & dry out your chicken. This way roast the chicken pieces in 2 to 3 batches, depending on the size of your skillet. Avoid browning in a non-stick pan.</li>
                <h2>Make Chicken Makhani</h2>
                <li>After 10 minutes, the sauce should have been thick and traces of fats visible on the sauce. If you want you may remove the whole spices & discard at this stage.</li>
                <li>Add chicken to the butter chicken gravy.</li>
                <li>Pour ½ cup more hot water if the sauce is too thick and simmer for about 5 to 7 minutes till it becomes tender. This is the time the sauce actually develops the flavors. The cook time may vary here. This additional half cup water is not mentioned in the recipe and is optional depending on how long you cook. But I always use.</li>
                <li>Add ½ to ¾ teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar and ½ tablespoon kasuri methi. Stir well and taste test. If required add more garam masala & another tablespoon butter for additional flavor.</li>
                <li>Stir in ¼ to ⅓ cup heavy cream. (If you have not used cashews, you will use ½ to 2/3 cup in total).</li>
