What making this basic website helped me to learn were the basic skills required for html files, such as the html boilerplate, setting the html language for the language i am presenting to the intended recipinets of the website, and the usage of the meta tag to determine the encoding being used on the website.

I have also learned how to use the head and body tags to seperate what shows up on the page wand what does not.

The purpose of creating a recipe website alllowed me to integrate unordered and ordered lists into the website as well allow me to see how other recipe website also use the list function.

To make the website not look like a word document, I also learned how to add images to the html documents using the <img> tags as well determine the height, width and the alt descriptions of the image.

I have also learned to link several different html pages together depending on if they were in the same directory or different direcrtories.
